# ConsoleGuess-Game
This is a super entertaining console game written by me in c++
#This console game generates a random number from a range that the player specifies and stores that random value.
#Then it asks the player to guess that number stored until the user gets it right.
#It also give the player clues as to whether or not the number the player guessed is greator or less than or very close or very far from the random number stores
#Written in c++. Hope you enjoy it:)
